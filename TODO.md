# TODO for Shop Page Fixes

## Steps to Complete

1. **Edit Shop.jsx**: Ensure search bar is at the top and remove any <h1> "Tienda" if present.
2. **Edit Shop.css**: Change grid to fit 4 cards per row by setting grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr) for larger screens.
3. **Edit ProductCard.css**: Adjust stock badge position to avoid overlap when scrolling (e.g., add z-index and ensure proper positioning).
4. **Test locally**: Run the development server to verify changes.
5. **Commit and push to GitHub**: Add, commit, and push the changes to the repository.
